# Multi-Layer Belief Model in Python

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of the Multi-Layer Belief model, as defined in the paper "A Belief Model for Conflicting and Uncertain Evidence: Connecting Dempster-Shafer Theory and the Topology of Evidence."

## Overview

The Multi-Layer Belief model is designed to compute degrees of belief based on uncertain evidence. This notebook provides data researchers with a user-friendly approach to understanding and applying this theoretical model through a toy example.

## Key Features

- Supports the computation of degrees of belief for propositions.
- Allows users to work with independent pieces of evidence, each with a degree of certainty between 0 and 1.
- Provides flexibility in setting evidence demand by the agent in order to compute different degree of belief for different situations. 
- Offers various justification frames and allocation functions for setting this evidence demand.

## Usage

1. Start by understanding the vocabulary of the model, which revolves around degrees of belief and evidence subsets.

2. Explore the Topology class and related functions, which help you understand the topological aspects of evidence.

3. Dive into the Multi Layer Belief Model class, which explains how the model works and how to set parameters for different interpretations.

4. Review the paper example to see how to apply the model in practice.

## Examples

The notebook provides practical examples and visualizations to help you understand the model's behavior and the impact of different parameter choices.
